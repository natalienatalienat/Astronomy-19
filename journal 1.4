#Write a Python program that declares a class describing your favorite animal. 
#Have the data members of the class represent the following physical parameters of the animal: 
#length of the arms (float), length of the legs (float), number of eyes (int), does it have a tail? (bool), is it furry? (bool). 
#Write an initialization function that sets the values of the data members when an instance of the class is created. 
#Write a member function of the class to print out and describe the data members representing the physical characteristics of the animal.
